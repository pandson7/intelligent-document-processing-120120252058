Project Owner: 
Solution Type: project
Timestamp: 1764651443592

CORE REQUIREMENT:
Build Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application with the following specifications:

1. USER INTERFACE:
   - Simple user interface for uploading documents
   - Display results once all 3 tasks are complete
   - Keep the User interface simple

2. DOCUMENT STORAGE:
   - Store uploaded documents in AWS storage
   - Trigger IDP pipeline upon upload

3. IDP PIPELINE (3 tasks in order):
   Task 1: OCR - Extract contents as key-value pair in JSON format
           - Handle markdown-wrapped JSON correctly
           - Support JPEG, PNG and PDF file formats
   
   Task 2: Document Classification
           - Categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Driver License, Invoice, W2, Other
   
   Task 3: Document Summarization

4. DATA STORAGE:
   - Store results of each task in DynamoDB
   - Display results in user interface once all 3 tasks complete

5. TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
   - Use sample documents from "~/ea_sample_docs/idp_docs" folder
   - Test end-to-end: file upload → data extraction → classification → summarization
   - Ensure all file formats (JPEG, PDF, PNG) work correctly
   - Check AWS documentation for each file format before implementing
   - Different services handle formats differently: Bedrock Claude: PDF as `document`, images as `image`

6. DEPLOYMENT:
   - Start development server and launch webapp
   - Ensure it works end to end with frontend actions and backend processing

CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- File upload from frontend works
- Data extraction in JSON format works for all formats
- Classification works for all formats  
- Summarization works for all formats
- Results display in frontend
- All file formats (JPEG, PDF, PNG) must be working before marking complete
